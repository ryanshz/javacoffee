derusting on some Java stuff over the summer

my plans for this repository are to make an inventory system using various concepts learned throughout school,
as well as adding other concepts learned on my own.

ADDING THIS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
 -once finished, redo in python (or the most appropriate language)
 -use prototyping process model to better determine requirements and functions
    - base this off current inventory systems in market
 -link to a database?
 -add more documentation
