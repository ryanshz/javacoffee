# javacoffee
javacoffee is an inventory management system that allows users to create and use a basic inventory from a given list of items, and generate reports based on those items.

## plans
Make an inventory system using various concepts learned throughout university, as well as adding other concepts learned on my own. This was initially a project to derust on Java over the summer, but I plan on reworking this into a larger project.

~~Once this is done, I'm planning on remaking this in Python with extra functionality, to practice a new language.~~ I'm going to continue developing this in Java and add extra
functionality. No longer developing pythoncoffee, shifting focus to this.

## future concepts to be used
- use some form of SDLC model to better determine requirements and functions
   - base this off current inventory systems in market
- link to a database
- add more documentation
