I used this repository to derust on Java over the summer.

## plans
Make an inventory system using various concepts learned throughout school, as well as adding other concepts learned on my own.
Once this is done, I'm planning on remaking this in Python with extra functionality, to practice a new language.

## future concepts to be used
 -use prototyping process model to better determine requirements and functions
    - base this off current inventory systems in market
 -link to a database
 -add more documentation
