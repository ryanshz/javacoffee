# javacoffee
javacoffee is an inventory management system that allows users to create and use a basic inventory from a given list of items, and generate reports based on those items.

## plans
Make an inventory system using various concepts learned throughout university, as well as adding other concepts learned on my own.

not planning on continuing to develop, don't use Java much and I'd like to shift my focus to other things
